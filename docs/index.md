# Overview

The SLG4682X Shield is an Arduino Uno R3 compatible Arduino Shield for the GreenPAK SLG46826 and SLG46824 Programmable Mixed-signal Matrix devices by Dialog Semiconductor.

Note: This shield should work fine with the following boards as well (but it has not been tested):

* Arduino Mega
* Arduino Duo
* And any 3.3V or 5V Arduino Uno compatible device

## SLG46824\SLG46826
The SLG46824\SLG46826 devices have similar functionality to a CPLD except they integrate a number of Analog components include comparators, voltage references, and a temperature sensor, all in a package that is programmed via I2C easily making it perfect for a number of projects from simple glue logic to driving LEDs with only a few pins.
